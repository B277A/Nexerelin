- Externalize strings: any?


- Supply mechanic (probably overcomplicating it)
- At least change lift cap mult to drop cost mult?
	- This doesn't do anything against AI though
	- Maybe instead units take damage when going through defenses?
	- What does spaceport do, reduce losses?
	
	- Idea: Drop damage from defenses, in addition to defenses resulting in higher supply cost to drop
		- Ground defenses: +0.1
		- Heavy batteries: +0.2
		- Planetary shield: x2
		- EW applies 0.5x drop damage mult?
		- Spaceport reduces drop costs

- Maybe AI just uses legacy invasion system?

- Invasion fleet -> ground forces conversion
