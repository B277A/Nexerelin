Mission 1
- AI core possessed by indie world that's bargaining between League, TT and Hegemony for it
- smash and grab for it
	- story point option to get the local authority to lower security?
- bring it back to Remnant contact for money and rep
	- or defy Remnants and keep core

Mission 2: Recover technology
- go to abandoned station in <system>
- it's surrounded by wrecks, but seems partly operational
- investigate: find a researcher 
	- station was destroyed in the last attack, but the Luddic Path attackers also took catastrophic losses and had to fall back
	- some "unusual" things were found here
- Luddic Path comes back for round 2
- player can demand to know what the special things are, or find out using technology skill
- it's a couple of Omega frigates
- can activate them to help with the defense; plug in two gamma cores lying around, or contribute your own betas or alphas
- now player has to either bail (losing the station) or fight off the enemies with or without the frigates
	- if player wins with the frigates, they self-destruct afterwards leaving their cores
	- if not, they fly off on their own to parts unknown
	- either way, there's some neat stuff in the station to salvage

Mission 3: Brawl ("Showdown")
- early warning of Hegemony operation against Remnant station in <system>; Midnight asks for assistance
	- cooler implementation: target and staging area are unknown; player needs to follow a fleet joining the attack forces from a core world market
	- once the straggler spawns, need to get to destination within time limit
		- straggler is marked as ignores-others-except-player and others-ignore-me
		- DELIVER_X assignment to location marker
		- once it arrives, or when player approaches the system, other enemy fleets spawn
		- once it arrives, or some time after it's killed, enemy fleets (spawn if they haven't already and) go to target
- get to target system, huge brawl between Heg+Luddic and Remnant fleets (with mercs fighting for Remnants too?)
- objective is to ensure the station and neutralize all enemy fleets
	- alternative route: join the attack instead (will lead to losing Midnight as a contact, and put player on the anti-Remnant route long term)
		- Allied forces are operating from a staging area with base, if one of them sees the player they will pursue and interrogate
		- Use story point to persuade, or fight (this triggers the battle stage immediately)
		- player is asked to scout the Remnant system
		- Interact with marked point near station to summon the attack
- Remnant route: On way back, be accosted by Hegemony or Luddic task force

Brawl dialog 

== Offer help ==
"Are you serious?"

You explain that you know of the Hegemony's plans for the Remnant station in $nex_remBrawl_targetSystemName, and how you can help. 
The Remnants do not yet know you have turned against them; hence, you will be able to take them by surprise. 
After all, it is nothing less than your duty as a citizen of the Domain and child of Mother Church to defeat the AI abomination wherever it arises.

The $personRank puts a hand on $hisOrHer forehead. "A moment, please. I... this is a matter for the admiral."


The officer's image disappears from your screen, replaced by the $faction crest. A few minutes later, it reappears, along with the image of a figure in a Hegemony admiral's uniform.

"So. I hear you have a proposition for me."


After your explanation, the admiral nods slowly. "A curious plan indeed. Yet it might give us the edge we need against these machines."

$nex_remBrawl_admiral_HeOrShe examines you like an unusual Domain artefact. "Here's what you can do for us. 
Travel to the $nex_remBrawl_targetSystemName and reconnoiter their positions, in particular their station. Then, transmit the encoded data to us. 
It'll be days old by the time we begin our assault, but that will still be valuable."

The admiral looks at you, one eye larger than the other. "If, of course, you are truly on our side."
> "You can count on me."
> (Lie) "You can count on me."

"Perfect. Now, be off with you. We'll be awaiting your signal."
