Mission 1
- AI core possessed by indie world that's bargaining between League, TT and Hegemony for it
- smash and grab for it
	- story point option to get the local authority to lower security?
- bring it back to Remnant contact for money and rep
	- or defy Remnants and keep core

Mission 2: Recover technology
- go to abandoned station in <system>
- it's surrounded by wrecks, but seems partly operational
- investigate: find a researcher 
	- station was destroyed in the last attack, but the Luddic Path attackers also took catastrophic losses and had to fall back
	- some "unusual" things were found here
- Luddic Path comes back for round 2
- player can demand to know what the special things are, or find out using technology skill
- it's a couple of Omega frigates
- can activate them to help with the defense; plug in two gamma cores lying around, or contribute your own betas or alphas
- now player has to either bail (losing the station) or fight off the enemies with or without the frigates
	- if player wins with the frigates, they self-destruct afterwards leaving their cores
	- if not, they fly off on their own to parts unknown
	- either way, there's some neat stuff in the station to salvage

Mission 3: Brawl ("Showdown")
- early warning of Hegemony operation against Remnant station in <system>; Midnight asks for assistance
	- cooler implementation: target and staging area are unknown; player needs to follow a fleet joining the attack forces from a core world market
	- once the straggler spawns, need to get to destination within time limit
		- straggler is marked as ignores-others-except-player and others-ignore-me
		- DELIVER_X assignment to location marker
		- once it arrives, or when player approaches the system, other enemy fleets spawn
		- once it arrives, or some time after it's killed, enemy fleets (spawn if they haven't already and) go to target
- get to target system, huge brawl between Heg+Luddic and Remnant fleets (with mercs fighting for Remnants too?)
- objective is to ensure the station and neutralize all enemy fleets
	- alternative route: join the attack instead (will lead to losing Midnight as a contact, and put player on the anti-Remnant route long term)
		- Allied forces are operating from a staging area with base, if one of them sees the player they will pursue and interrogate
		- Use story point to persuade, or fight (this triggers the battle stage immediately)
		- player is asked to scout the Remnant system
		- Interact with marked point near station to summon the attack
- Remnant route: On way back, be accosted by Hegemony or Luddic task force
