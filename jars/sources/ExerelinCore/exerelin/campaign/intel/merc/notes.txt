Hiring a mercenary company requires 1 story point.

The employer is responsible for upkeep, maintenance and crewing of the provided ships. 
The minimal amount of crew needed to operate the provided ships will be supplied by AIM 
at the start of the contract, and removed when it ends.

Ships that come with an officer may not have their officer changed. 
The employer may place their own officers on other ships at their discretion.

When the company is returned to AIM, if the value of the remaining ships is less 
than their value at the time of contract signing (due to losses, battle damage, or any other cause), 
the employer will pay %s of the difference.
