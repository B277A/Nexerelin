TO DO FOR STARSECTOR 0.97

Files to check on Starsector update, because they significantly modify vanilla code that could change under us.
Partial list.

Most likely to have changed:
- NexCoreLifecyclePlugin

Others:
- ExerelinNewGameSetup
    - VanillaSystemsGenerator
- rules.csv "vanilla overrides"
- NexFleetInteractionDialogPluginImpl
- NexFleetEncounterContext
- Nex_PunitiveExpeditionManager
- Nex_MarketCMD
- Nex_SustainedBurnAbilityAI
- Nex_AICores
- NexHostileActivityEventIntel, NexHostileActivityManager
- [idk] SSP_BattleCreationPluginImpl
- InvasionFleetManager.getPatrolCombatFP
- Submarket plugins
- Colony manager: getFreePortGrowthBonus()
- Objective entity plugins

Honestly, do I care?
- Everything that uses Industries.TAG_UNRAIDABLE
- CreateFleetPlugin if I make one


0.96 notes:

Do on future SS release:
- Use "player colonized" and deciv listeners
	- Deciv listener applications:
		- Sector manager (faction elimination): useless, we don't know who the previous owner was
			- Just use it to run the live faction check
		- We do have a pre-deciv checker that works
	- Player colonized listener applications:
		- Faction setup nag script
	- But on the other hand the periodic check we already have works fine, don't fix what ain't broke
