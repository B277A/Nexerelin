0.96 notes:

0.95 notes:
- SSP_BattleCreationPluginImpl looks RIP, it can't access needed variables from the data class

Do on future SS release:
- Use "player colonized" and deciv listeners
	- Deciv listener applications:
		- Sector manager (faction elimination): useless, we don't know who the previous owner was
			- Just use it to run the live faction check
		- We do have a pre-deciv checker that works
	- Player colonized listener applications:
		- Faction setup nag script? mehhh

- Nex_BlueprintSwap: Remove starting "$" from POINTS_KEY (it's now a persistent data key, not a memory key)
