Files to check on Starsector update, because they significantly modify vanilla code that could change under us.
Partial list.

- NexCoreLifecyclePlugin
- NexFleetInteractionDialogPluginImpl
- NexFleetEncounterContext
- [needs updating] Nex_MarketCMD
- Nex_SustainedBurnAbilityAI
- [deprecated] SSP_BattleCreationPluginImpl
- InvasionFleetManager.getPatrolCombatFP
- Submarket plugins
- Colony manager: getFreePortGrowthBonus()
- Everything that uses Industries.TAG_UNRAIDABLE

	needs checking:
	- [updated] Nex_PunitiveExpeditionManager
	- [no change needed?] NexFleetInteractionDialogPluginImpl
	- [no change needed?] NexFleetEncounterContext
	- [no change] Nex_SustainedBurnAbilityAI
	- [no change] InvasionFleetManager.getPatrolCombatFP
	- [updated] Submarket plugins
	- [no change] getFreePortGrowthBonus()
	- [no change] Industries.TAG_UNRAIDABLE

last thing to look at is Nex_MarketCMD

0.95 notes:
- SSP_BattleCreationPluginImpl looks RIP, it can't access needed variables from the data class

Do on future SS release:
- [done] ExerelinConfig/ExerelinFactionConfig: Shorten class/method names
- [done] Remove agent/saboteur commodities
- [done] Remove MutableStatNoFloor
- Use "player colonized" and deciv listeners
	- Deciv listener applications:
		- Sector manager (faction elimination): useless, we don't know who the previous owner was
			- Just use it to run the live faction check
	- Player colonized listener applications:
		- Faction setup nag script? mehhh

- Nex_BlueprintSwap: Remove starting "$" from POINTS_KEY (it's now a persistent data key, not a memory key)
- [done] Move CeasefirePromptIntel to diplomacy package
