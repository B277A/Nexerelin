ms_charybdis,SHIP,"Perhaps the fastest and, for it's size, best armed carrier in the sector, the Charybdis-class Strike Carrier is well suited for exploration and combat deep in hostile territory. 

However, these vessels formidable combat capabilities have come at rather severe cost; the Charybdis suffered from severely conflicting development goals and it's design is marred by a number of potentially fatal compromises.

Though well automated and easy to work with, the Charybdis' hangar capacity is easily the lowest of any carrier vessel of this general size.  It's strong offensive abilities and speed also come at the cost of having the thinnest armor belt of any cruiser in service, and it's hull is markedly fragile for it's mass.  Most worryingly is it's low flux capacity for a modern vessel, which is worsened by it's relatively inefficient systems and poor rate of flux dissipation.

These severe defensive shortcomings, and it's comparatively high cost, have left it difficult to integrate in a standard order of battle, and thus it rare even among Tri-Tachyons security divisions.  Still, it is quite popular with Mercenary captains and small corporations with good funding reserves, as it's speed and offensive power is not easily dismissed."

ms_morningstar,SHIP,"The Morningstar is Shadowyards Heavy Industries 'flagship' class; a small, slightly assymetric destroyer with a solid array of energy mounts and two small missile hardpoints.

The ship is named for it's highly distinctive sensor system, the spines near the front of the hull.  In the past they were fitted with extended range combat sensors, but are now commonly fitted with tech scanners; as such, the vessel is commonly seen in the hands of middling tech mining operations.

While lacking redundancy, the ships unusual extended drive system provides good speed, and is remarkably fuel efficient.  An array of potent thrusters, combined with the ships length, offer excellent agility for it's size.  It's shields, while not a straight up match for the Medusa, are paired with one of the best flux dissipation systems in the sector, giving it good battlefield longevity.  Unfortunately, however, like most S.H.I. vessels its advantages come at the cost of a middling armor belt and fragile hull. 

A small hangar bay allows the Morningstar to support a limited number of fighters or drones, enhancing it's self-sufficiency."

ms_enlil,SHIP,"The Enlil is one of the most flexible vessels in existence; designed to be a true multi-role frigate, it's three forward Universal hardpoints allow it to fit nearly any mission role, while two small energy hardpoints provide rearward defense.

Comparatively more sturdily built than most S.H.I. offerings, the vessel is of only modest speed for it's size.  Despite this it is quite maneuverable and capable bringing it's formidable forward armament to bear on most targets fairly easily.  While it's forward mounted weaponry lends itself to an attack role, the frigate is most often fitted in a bewildering variety of fashions to serve as a "Jack-of-All-Trades" frigate; while rarely as good as whatever vessel it is emulating it's flexability allows it to fill holes in the battle line quite neatly."

ms_seski,SHIP,"Designed with speed in mind, the Seski class corvette is among the fastest ships in the sector.  Most often used as a fast picket or blockade runner, it is occasionally put to use as a light cavalry unit.

The Seski relies almost entirely upon its speed and maneuverability to survive battle; it's armor is practically nonexistant and it's shield array lacks the bredth to defend it from concentrated assault, and it's small size has limited the amount of capacitors it can carry.  While decently armed for it's diminuitive size it is not expected to be able to take on a combat frigate in a slugging match."

ms_shamash,SHIP,"Sleek and deadly, the Shamash has built up a formidable reputation as a hunter/killer frigate.

Her phase cloak system, while significantly less efficient than those of the Domain, is far less costly to activate. For those willing to entertain a somewhat more aggressive hunting style, this brings a formidable advantage, always playing on the knifes edge, phasing in and out to avoid and deliver critical harm."

ms_inanna,SHIP,"The Inanna is the oldest vessel of Shadowyards manufacture still in common use.  Her design has recieved considerable upgrades over the years, but ultimately has retained her inherent sturdiness and punishing broadside."

ms_sargasso,SHIP,"The Sargasso is one of the more effective small carriers in the Sector, particularly with the highly sophisticated Space Control systems available to her, giving her fighter wings superior intelligence and response time."

ms_elysium,SHIP,"Built around the fearsome 'Pandora Array,' the Elysium has appeared only recently among SHI's fleets; while her primary armament is worriesome, the real danger often stems from her deadly broadsides."

ms_mimir,SHIP,"The largest purely combat vessel manufactured by SHI, the Mimir is a formidable battlecruiser.  Her firepower is centered around a super heavy phase cannon most commonly called the Níðhöggr Lance."

ms_skinwalker,SHIP,"The Skinwalker is a highly mobile, advanced fighter design intended to provide top cover against enemy fighter craft; utilizing it's ir pulse laser and blackcap missile system, it presents a serious threat to enemy fighter wings.

While not exceptionally heavily armed, it possesses a unique high-density flux capacitor, which, combined with it's speed, agility and broad shielding make it difficult to overwhelm; should these fail, the skinwalker is still quite tough, giving the pilot time to elude her harrasers and return to base."

ms_neriad,SHIP,"Designed to be launched from planetary bases, the Neriad is a rare aerospace fighter design amongst the more commonly space based fighter craft encountered in the sector.

A light assault cannon gives it mixed utility against fighters and frigates, and its single 'Shrike' class anti-ship missile theoretically allows it to threaten larger craft.  Low cost and ease of maintenance were key design goals for the craft, as they were intended to maintain a cheap garrison force for local planetary govenors.  While they doubtlessly succeeded, the craft can only barely be considered a modern generation fighter.  S.H.I. has spread these fighters to near ubiquity across underdefended worlds throughout the sector, and its low price point have made it reasonably popular among independent spacers as well."

ms_blackcap_3x,WEAPON,"The Blackcap is a short ranged anti-fighter missile with an excellent guidance package.

An integrated missile system produced almost exclusively by Shadowyards Heavy Industry, 'revolver' style autoloader increases speed and mechanical reliability.

ms_cepc,WEAPON,"The CECP, or Carried Energy Pulse Cannon, is a Shadowyards Heavy Industries made weapon system capable of high burst damage.

Rather than fire the bolt through a typical lasing medium or projector, SHI's researchers opted to utilize a physical medium to act as a carrier for the energy pulse.  While the method has proven to be somewhat more efficient than many other methods and can produce highly damaging bolts, the Charge Carrier Medium (CCM) must be charged before firing, resulting in a limited capacity of available shots at any given time.  The CECP's fire rate is more than sufficient for this to lead to noticeable drops in combat efficiency in fairly short time frames.",Close Support,,

ms_pdcepc,WEAPON,"The Light variant of the CEPC is the most recent version to enter service, focused on maintaining a high fire rate with excellent accuracy.

Cyclic loading chambers allow the weapon to maintain an extremely high rate of fire; charge carriers are small but capable of reasonable damage at short range.  High accuracy and limited engagement envelope leave it most effective for providing Close Weapons Support against enemy fighters and missiles.",Point Defense,,

ms_mcepc,WEAPON,"The Medium CEPC is a starndard combat weapon amongst Shadowyards Heavy Industry forces, well regarded as a reliable and deadly weapons platform.

Most simply described as five regular CECP's strapped together, the Scatter CECP is at home in all manner of attack roles but is most ideal for quick, overwhelming strikes.  Efficient loading system ensures new charges are cycled rapidly, though this hampered by a limited charge capacity and the sheer quantity of fire it can produce. Reasonably tight spread allows enhanced odds of hitting a target while still maintaining the weapons damage.",Assault,,

Controls and flux systems have been upgraded heavily, and this ship now relies largely on energy weaponry.",,
"junk_pirates_clam","SHIP","A heavy frigate blessed with a very useful, full coverage shield and some reasonable armor.

All this high technology has placed an unfortunate limit on the offensive capabilities of the craft, with the main capabilities coming from its missile payload.

Although It will always have couple assisting vessels and swarms of fighters protecting it from bombers, small fighters that would be capable of avoiding Omegas main weapons. 


Due to the limitations of the supply convoys, because the ships demand for supply is over the charts, Omega sometimes operates alone with only a small fighter protection. This is a possible strategic flaw, as the single ship could in theory be defeated by larger numbers, possibly crippling it in enemy space, or managing to kill enough crew members in combat, leaving the ship vulnerable to large boarding parties, but the Tri-Tachyon corporation does not think of it as a valid threat. There's a good catch to it though, since the ship alone poses a great threat, Tri-Tachyon spy network deliberately sends out many fake messages about the ships next certain route, destination. While enemy fleets investigate, normal attacks from Tri-Tachyon are very effective. Money well spend, indeed.

Surprisingly the Old Remnant gave several Overlords to the Hegemony aswell as the Loyalists straight away.

Based on the blueprints provided by the Old Council Remnant, the Spearhead was constructed to have better protection against incoming fire and carry heavier weapons. The ships hull was extended and more powerful engines were installed too.

This design itself lead to a relatively high price of the Spearhead class.. and needless to say, many captains rather chose Slashers, whenever they were given the option, over the Spearhead.

On top of that, there were very specific demands for the compact size of this new weapon.

The decision was made quickly to use the Assault Gun as a reference and use as many parts form it as possible. It was decided to use the same barrel and recoil dumping system, but the barrel was easily adjusted to use a bigger projectile. The rate of fire had to be lowered in this situation though, because if the original setting from the A.G. were untempered the recoil increased rapidly with each shot - the barrel was not designed for the new projectiles.

Because of that it was decided to use two barrel configuration, which increased the potential damage output and increased the rate of fire, while keeping a decent accuracy of the weapon. The only downside of this configuration, besides its cost, was the fact that due to the the final demand - for compact size of the system, the space for additional ammo was quite limited and was never too high.

Adding to its sleek and fast design, the Sentinel is equipped with capable ballistic systems and finds its hull covered in modern pressure plates. However, all this means that there is little space for a proper crew or subsystems.",,,
frigate_azores,SHIP,"The Azores served as prototype platform to the new ion-gas algae powered engines.

It performed rather well, though later designs refined on the original prototype. This leaves the Azores a relatively slow frigate. Relatively, for it is still able to reach impressive speeds. Its other systems perform quite well. All in all, the Azores is a cheap but reliable ship. It is able to wield a battery of five pressurized turrets.",,,
frigate_anchor,SHIP,"The Anchor was once used for extended research missions beneath the Celadon Sea of Atlantis.

It comes with an augmented fan-controlled and ion-gas propelled engine system and superior pressure plating. However, it does lack in the ballistics department, granting it little damage output in combat. Its mid-section can only hold a small battery of three turrets.",,,
frigate_forlorn,SHIP,"The Forlorn was designed to break up rock and crystalline formations below the Celadon Sea.

It has superior ballistic systems, yet lacks in the pressure-plate department. It cannot take much of a beating before its hull is breached and its internal systems are exposed. However, its reasonably capable engines allow it to perform well during hit-and-run tactics. Allowing it to strike swiftly and retreat out of weapons range just as quickly.",,,
frigate_cape,SHIP,"The Cape is a modern design. It is sleek, well-rounded and costly.

Plus it can accommodate more personnel than any other frigate-classed Antediluvian ship. It is often described as the researcher cruise-ship, offering relatively luxury accommodations to its crew. It is also used as launch for the commanding officers of larger ships.",,,

The Donovan is a well-rounded and advanced submarinal- and space craft. It sports five ballistic mounts and is nearly fully covered in pressure plates. It is also internally reinforced by the latest in bulkhead technology, warding off both aquatic pressure and the punishments of outer space. It is the only frigate in the Antediluvian fleet able to field a sonic turret.",,,
destroyer_timaeus,SHIP,"The Timaeus was originally designed to serve as a deep-ocean vessel of exploration.

Its massive size and enormous bulkheads allowed for it to withstand the brutal pressures of the deep seas, like no other vessel before it. It also offered large amounts of space for research personnel and equipment. Launching a Timaeus into space proved difficult due to its sheer mass and size. Its own engines simply could not power the vessel through Atlantis' atmosphere. Hence a Planetary Launch-System (PLS) was constructed, firing the Timaeus off through the planet's atmosphere, much like a bullet, and away from its gravitational pull.",,,
destroyer_critias,SHIP,"When the shipyards of Atlantis were cleared of the Timaeas Project, it presented Antediluvian scientists with the perfect construction site for a new class of vessel, of roughly equal size and tonnage.

The Critias was deviced and constructed shorty after. It was designed with extra-planetary warfare in mind, sporting a great weapons array and superior engine capabilities, never before seen in Antediluvian hands.",,,
cruiser_oracle,SHIP,"The newer destroyer-classed ships of Atlantis were designed with interchangeable modular compartments in mind.

The first vessel to benefit from these modular options was the Oracle. It was pieced together utilizing the Timaeus' and Critias' most stable and powerful components. The final result was too large to be pieced together in the Timaeus Moor in one stage. Thus Antediluvian engineers decided to construct an aft and bow section separately. Then merge the two parts in open sea, on floating constructs, before launching it into space. The Oracle proved so powerful that it received a classification of its own, as pocket-cruiser.",,,
destroyer_poseidon,SHIP,"A destroyer-classed weapons satellite, due to its size and power core. The Poseidon offers room to two heavy sonic weapon systems.

It can rotate quickly, enabling it to constantly bring its weapons to bear. It is a slow vessel, best used for defensive tasks. The Poseidon was constructed right outside the Timaeus Moor, able to float on its own buoyant hull. It too had to be send through orbit by means of PLS.",,,
cruiser_gibborim,SHIP,"A large weapons station designed to store supplies, fuel and personnel in the orbit of Atlantis, making these easily accessible for Antediluvian shuttles.

Its armour is thick, its bulkheads and reinforced structure unmatched. This station is well able to defend itself. However, it lacks in speed as it was not designed to participate in direct combat. A larger fleet, however, might find it useful to take a Gibborim along for added supplies, and its ability to reinforce key strategic points on the field of battle.",,,
cruiser_deluge,SHIP,"Named for the Great Flood. The Deluge was the first dedicated cruiser to be designed by Antediluvian engineers.

It was constructed in low orbit of Atlantis, as no shipyard could offer sufficient space for the construction of such a vessel. Even if they did have the accommodations, the Deluge simply proved too massive to be launched from the PLS. The Deluge cruiser is a reasonably fast ship. Though it is not very maneuverable. It makes up for its lack of turning by offering impressive weapon arrays at both broadsides. The first Deluge was constructed at Athens station, in low orbit of Atlantis.",,,

A taste of what Cerulean City might hold is brought forth by the appearance of these massive orbital colonies. The Calypso class acts as a city district, constructed in low orbit. Bringing the Antedeluvians closer to the heavens. The choice that lead to the construction of these massive sky-cities was not one of dreams and philosophy. Instead it was simply logistically more efficient to have large supplies of personnel and resources in low orbit, easily accessible to those in space.",,,
cruiser_gadeirus,SHIP,"The Gadeirus was designed by a niche of scientists specialized in Alloys and Irregular Material Sciences (ARMS-department).

The result of their efforts was a cruiser-classed vessel, much heavier than the Deluge class. Weapon systems sprouted out across the ship's heavy armour plating. Very few systems remained vulnerable and unprotected. All in all the Gadeirus was a heavier dedicated cruiser than the Deluge. However, it also proved to be slower and less maneuverable. A flaw it made up for by bringing additional sonic weaponry to bear.",,,
frigate_column,SHIP,"A small armed satellite initially meant to provide light support against incoming missiles and strikecraft.

The Column is often seen in the company of larger satellites and stations. It is armed with an array of torpedo launchers and a basic turret emplacement. The launchers would prove more useful in the field than its lone pressure turret, thus its role of point defense was quickly changed to that of torpedo boat.",,,
capital_atlantis,SHIP,"The Atlantis was the first starship ever to be created by Antediluvian engineers. At its core, it had a Calypso-class colony as bridge, attached to a massive engine that acted as aft section.

It was well equipped to perform numerous tasks in the black of space, under the guise of research and exploration. In size it would only be surpassed by the Atol harbourship, a much more recent design. It was equipped with batteries of point defense pressure turrets, main battle turrets, sonic emplacements and an array of torpedo launchers.",,,
pressureturret,WEAPON,"The APT-10 'Plato' Antediluvian Pressure Turret. A high pressure barrel, fitted upon a rotating base.

Special hydraulics allow for this turret to expel slugs of metal at incredible velocity, regardless of exterior pressure. This makes the APT-10 ideal for underwater and extra-planetary duty. A relatively small projectile. The PPS is a solid titanium slug, fired from a range of Antediluvian pressure operated weaponsystems. The slug is on average 2 meters in length and 1.5 meters wide. The sheer force behind the impact, generated by its velocity, can cause great trauma to a ship's hull. For it to maintain a straight heading in the weightlessness of space (as it did in the weightlessness of Atlantis' ocean) the slug must be propelled through a rifled barrel. Antediluvian pressure weapons of all sorts also excel at point defense.","Point Defense",

deucalion,WEAPON,"ATL-10 'Deucalion' Antediluvian Torpedo Launcher. A high pressure launcher for highly volatile warheads.

The ATL-10 launcher allows to fire off any compatible torpedo plus warhead at incredible velocity. The initial propellant velocity grants the object its range and power of impact, both underwater and in space. The impact is augmented by the conserning warhead. The HPT is a semi gas-operated projectile, hosting an explosive warhead. The projectile is initially fired from an Antediluvian launch bay, under high pressures. Immediatly after leaving the torpedo tube, the projectile will start to power itself by means of a small ionized gas reserve, giving it an even greater action-range. The torpedo itself is hollow, made from a titanium alloy.","Fire Support",

sonicturret,WEAPON,"ASP-10 'Solon' Antediluvian Sonic Pulse Turret. Sound equals vibration. Vibrations carry far across the seas. Much farther than it would over land.

This simple reasoning lead to the development of the ASP-10 by Antediluvian researchers. By creating a Drum-Chamber within the barrel of a torpedo-tube, ionized algy gasses could produce a great vibration, upon ignition. This essentially allowed the barrel to send forth a directed pulse of sonic energy. The vibrations within this pulse were so heavy, that it could cause rocks to shatter and armor plates to loosen, buckle and give way. Even organic matter would splatter when hit by a sonic pulse. The effectiveness of a sonic pulse would diminish after covering a certain distance.","Strike",

cerberus,SHIP,"A fully militarized Tri-Tachyon advanced variant of the venerable Hound class fast frigate, Cerberus is fast to produce, cheap and readily available to fill Tri-Tachyon scout and light escort roles. 

In comparison to its predecessor the Hound class, Cerberus trades armor with a more modern energy core, allowing both greater speed and the installation of a small shield emitter. 

Originally re-designed as a cheap stopgap for merchant escort and resupply roles, the Cerberus is used everywhere to protect Tri-Tachyon interests from pirates and harassers, but is not suited to the modern big fleet battlefield due to its origins."
pointer,SHIP,"A fully militarized Hegemony advanced variant of the venerable Hound class fast frigate, Pointer is fast to produce, cheap and readily available to fill Hegemony scout and light escort roles. 

In comparison to its predecessor the Hound class, Pointer trades speed and point defence for more armour and survivability, giving the adventurous pilot a platform that can take a lot of punishment while keeping hot on his target.

Originally re-designed as a cheap stopgap for merchant escort and resupply roles, the Pointer is used everywhere to protect Hegemony interests from pirates and harassers, but is not suited to the modern big fleet battlefield due to its origins."
eventide,SHIP,"The Eventide-class cruiser is a reverse-engineered variant of the Aurora-class. Ordered by the Lotus Pirate conglomerate as a fast flagship, the Eventide excels at interdiction, keeping at bay most adversaries. 

The Eventide is an amalgam of salvaged Tri-Tachyon parts, reverse-engineered components and home-brew stopgaps. It does not look pretty, and fortunately it doesn't need to. After all, the Lotus Pirates are renowned for their cutthroat efficiency, not their cleaning skills. 

In comparison to its fully militarized Tri-Tachyon counterpart, the Eventide trades energy efficiency and weapon range for brute force and speed. Re-designed for attacking convoys and terrorizing the shipping lanes, the Eventide is faster than ships of its current size, but lacks the technology to stand in a true line of battle. 

It was never meant to anyway..."
hydra,SHIP,"The Hydra-class fast Hunter Destroyer serves as a prime example of what happens when close guarded military blueprints fall into the..wrong hands. The Lotus Conglomerate was only too keen to oblige, and the rest is history. 

Re-fitted as a fast hunter destroyer for convoy assault, the Hydra is essentially a custom built Medusa-class destroyer, built to outmaneuver merchant marine escorts and to outlast all but its heaviest class counterparts. 

Used as the flagship of small Lotus raider fleets, the Hydra trades armor and energy efficiency for speed and close-quarters firepower. In the search for speed even basic amenities are spared in the design. And it shows. 

Not that the pirates care though..."
stigma,SHIP,"The Stigma is a custom Broadsword fighter class variant, modified for fast convoy attack duties. Trading armor for speed and combat range for close support lethality, the Stigma excels as a raider. 

The Lotus anchorage ground in Posterior IIb is renown for converting salvaged parts into highly lethal (and expensive to boot) pieces of ordnance. The Stigmas produced there are a prime example of that, favored by Buccaneers and Mercenaries alike for their speed and close-quarters brutality. 

And rightfully so. The motto 'Fast, close and personal' was made for this ship after all... "
blizzard,SHIP,"Sometimes referred to as the 'quintessential' raider, the Blizzard-class is a build-to-order frigate hull that is constructed at the Lotus anchorage ground in Posterior IIb.

Built to last a lifetime in the hands of a worthy captain, the Blizzard is a fast frigate design based on stolen Tri-Tachyon blueprints and manufactured for the Lotus Pirate conglomerate as a fast attack craft against heavily escorted convoys. 

The Blizzard packs the long range punch needed for standoff engagements and is armed with 2 small and 1 medium missile hardpoints, making it an excellent choice for pursuing merchant fleets and light escorts alike. Alas, it is notoriously flimsy at short range combat and needs to keep the 'weather gage' at all times.

Thankfully, its powerful twin RBo1x engines can help with that. To the delight of many a Lotus Corsair..."
jackal,SHIP,"Designed exclusively for the Lotus Pirates by the Posterior II Anchorage ground, this fragile, fast and furious little frigate design is the Lotus Co equivalent of a mosquito bringing a sledgehammer to a summer dance party. 

The Jackal-class fast Hunter frigate is a raider variant of the high-tech Tri-Tachyon branded Wolf frigate, trading survivability for speed and versatility for raw power. Its 2 medium hardpoints can put to the test most merchant escorts of its size, while its tritium supercharged X01a engines can ensure that beefier adversaries will stay out of reach. 

Armed like a Leprechaun guarding its gold and armored like a virgin from Procyon in a Corvean slumber party, the Jackal brings out the true essence of what the Lotus Conglomerate is known about...'Take the money and run!'..."
javelin,SHIP,"Fusing the high tech pedigree of the Xyphos-class with the elegance of a brigade of drunk Corvean welders, the Javelin-class is a custom built heavy fighter hull designed to overwhelm even the heaviest escort detachment.

Designed exclusively for the Lotus Pirates by the Posterior II Anchorage ground, this crude but extremely effective design is the product of industrial espionage, home-brew solutions and space whiskey. A lot of space whiskey to be precise. 

Trading protection for speed, and beam weapons for a easier to field (and finance) load-out, the Javelin strikes fear into all but the most courageous of pilots that have to engage it. Rightfully so, because in worthy hands this heavy fighter can obliterate almost any opposition from adversaries of its size."
argos,SHIP,"Designed as a fast blockade runner and optimized for auxiliary use as a general supply ship, the Argos-class freighter is the workhorse of Lotus Co smuggling and contraband divisions. 

Based on the venerable Tarsus-class, the Argos is converted to carry double the fuel amount (the extra space sometimes used for smuggling Corvean high grade Brandy), and to service a small raider fleet by itself. The engines have also been upgraded via tritium supercharging so as to enable the unwieldy freighter hull to pass through blockade points easier. 

Mass-converted at the Posterior II Anchorage ground, the Tarsus hulls are also stripped of much of their famous armor so as to give more room for cargo, ammunitions and the engine superchargers. This makes the Argos rather flimsy in comparison to its Domain designed cousin. 

Not that the pirates care much though..."
revolver,WEAPON," Typically seen in Lotus Co larger raider hulls, the 20mm revolver autocannon is designed to instill fear to all but the most courageous bomber pilots. 
Based on the venerable Hegemony vulcan, the revolver uses a cylinder with multiple chambers, like those of a revolver handgun, to speed up the loading-firing-ejection cycle. Loaded with 20mm SAPHEI (Semi-Armor Piercing High Explosive Incendiary) rounds, this autocannon design excels at point defense while the larger caliber gives it also better range than its multi-barreled counterpart. At the cost of higher flux and slower RoF though.",Point Defense
vanquish,SHIP,"Ordered as the flagship of Conglomerate flotillas in the Core, the Vanquish-class battlecruiser is the biggest, baddest and most frightening sight a merchant captain could ever witness. Usually, the last too.  

Converted from the venerable Conquest class (at great monetary and resource cost for the Lotus Co) the Vanquish serves as the home of almost 600 rabid pirates, and holds all the ammunition, cargo and fuel that a pirate flotilla would need in an extended patrol. Compared to its Domain designed cousin, the Vanquish adds another power core (above the bridge) so as to support its 8 tritium supercharged XoR01 engines, giving it more speed than anything of its size could dream of. The forward superstructure also houses a small hangar bay for servicing small craft.

These extensive modifications come at the cost of armor and hull integrity, making the Vanquish rather flimsy for its size and armament. The fact that the hull is mainly constructed from salvaged Conquest wreckages found around the De-civilised worlds does not help either. 

But the pirates are not concerned with such technicalities..."
arcadia,SHIP,"Known as the fastest ship in the Core that can service small craft, the Arcadia-class light carrier exemplifies the mentality that the Lotus Conglomerate operates with: 'Be fast, be first, be loaded'...

A conversion from the financially disastrous Hegemony Valkyrie-class, this hull can service up to 15 standard unit points of small craft, while providing luxurious accommodations for flight crews (like heated bunks and tachyon-coffee makers).

Most of its predecessors' armor and troop quarters are removed so as to provide room for the large hangar bay and support equipment. The energy core is also downgraded, mainly due to the defective original plans that had the main conduits pass through the whole length of the ship.
When used with caution, the Arcadia can prove extremely valuable for every raider fleet. If escort wings are not kept at bay though, this flimsy design is a disaster waiting to happen. 
Fortunately, the Lotus Co pirates are aware of that..."
rive,SHIP," A custom design that excels in raiding sorties against fast supply convoys, the Rive-class is used en-mass by the Lotus Co for almost all fleet tasks, earning the nickname "FeatherSledge" among pirate flottilas.

And with good reason. Derived from the Hammerhead and Sunder classes, this warship was built for concentrated firepower. Essentially a Core Epoch design put into the LotusWorks grinder and then re-assembled with scotch tape, this fast and agile destroyer can out-maneuver most escorts of its size, while keeping its enormous arsenal trained on them. 

Most of the armor is dismounted from the parts salvaged to make the hull (for monetary and feasibility reasons), so as to keep the design light yet sturdy enough to support the inclusion of a battleship sized ballistic slot for long range combat. Also, a bigger energy core is installed to both fuel the much beefier engines and the large ballistic mount. 

The result is a ship that almost falls apart with every round it fires, but needs far fewer rounds than anything of its size.

Some call this controversial. The Lotus Pirates just call it marvelous..."
ajax,SHIP," Based on an originally modified by the Green Sun Pirates Falcon-class prototype, the Ajax Light raider Cruiser is an oddity among ships of its size, both in intended use and traits. 

Re-designed as a fast raider by the Lotus Co, this hull serves as the flagship in fast wolf packs intended to strike fast and with force against merchant shipping. For this purpose, much of the original armor is stripped away to make room for a bigger engine room to house 4 Xo1r tritium supercharged engines, a standard modification for Conglomerate designs. 

The result is a Cruiser sized hull that can take less hits than many destroyers do, while having the speed that most destroyers lack. The extra room is also put into good use for stowing enough supplies to service an entire wolf pack on its own. 

As long as the holds are still intact at least..."
stinger,WEAPON,"A rack of advanced, highly maneuverable torpedoes, smaller than typical torpedoes.

The Stinger lightweight torpedo is a custom 480mm guided torpedo design manufactured for the Lotus Conglomerate pirates. Derived from the high-tech Atropos class guided torpedo, the Stinger replaces the potent chemical warhead with a conventional High Explosive Squash Head charge, managing to strip enough weight so as to fit an upgraded supercharged ion engine. 

The result is a torpedo with less punch than weapons of its type, but with far higher agility and speed. Both of them highly sought after by the Pirates due to the 'hit and run' tactics they are accustomed with.",Strike
stinger_single,WEAPON,"A single advanced, highly maneuverable torpedo, smaller than typical torpedoes.

The result is a torpedo with less punch than weapons of its type, but with far higher agility and speed. Both of them highly sought after by the Pirates due to the 'hit and run' tactics they are accustomed with.

This heavier mount features an auto-loading system, enabling larger craft like destroyers and cruisers to efficiently fire devastating torpedo salvos.",Strike
cutlass,SHIP,"The pride of the Posterior Anchorage design bureau, this heavy bomber hull is specifically built around the Stinger lightweight torpedo weapon, producing an unparalleled strike platform for its size.

Utilizing the latest technology that the Lotus Co can muster, the Cutlass bomber incorporates features like tritium supercharging and helium targeting stabilizers to achieve a fast yet smooth enough for pinpoint targeting ride. Armor is applied as an afterthought, mainly because of the prohibitive cost that dense core alloys have, especially in the black market.

If escorted properly to the target, the Cutlass delivers handsomely, rightfully earning the nickname 'Orange Death' among merchant marine captains.

And for good measure..."
hdstinger,WEAPON,"Dual torpedo launcher system, used for launching lightweight torpedo barrages from a single hardpoint from ships that can accommodate its size requirements.

A very large weapon system, the Heavy stinger launcher is listed as having two 480mm torpedo tubes with an internal magazine that carries twenty four Stinger light torpedoes. The fire control system is linked, and fires four Stinger torpedoes in tandem. An automatic loader prepares the next salvo from the magazine in seconds.

Although the Stingers used lack the punch of regular heavyweight torpedoes, this launcher fits a niche in capital ships that need heavier guided munitions but lack the maneuverability to aim them efficiently.",Strike
bolt,SHIP," Built around the 20mm revolver autocannon, the Bolt-class interceptor fighter is one of the fastest fighters put in mass-production in the Core. It is also one of the flimsiest. 

Often described as 'the coffin with thrusters', Bolt interceptors serve as fast raiders against lightly armored and armed merchant marine targets. They are fast, cheap and easy to produce, but lack the firepower and protection needed for anything other than harassment duties. 

The life expectancy while flying this hull is so low, that Pilots are often chosen as a sort of punishment for dereliction of duty (a common offense among pirate crews). 

And the fact that most offenders prefer marooning when given the choice, tells a lot about the Bolt indeed..."
stingray,SHIP,"With four magnetically boosted small ballistic turrets utilized in area defense roles, the Stingray-class fire support Frigate is a force to be reckoned with for any bomber pilot. 

Maybe the ugliest of the Posterior II offerings, the Stingray resembles more the fish that its name is derived from than a frigate, with the added disadvantage of being very difficult to produce, due to the scarcity of Hydra class destroyer hulls it uses as a base. 

As a result, the Stingray is rarely in Lotus Conglomerate flotillas and it is used mainly to protect valuable shipping assets when used in blockade runs."
aria,SHIP," Based on an antiquated Domain super-tanker blueprint, the Aria-class is a medium sized fleet tanker built to support Lotus Co long range operations against distant trade routes.

The Pirates use this ship to double the effective range of their wolf packs, thus allowing both long range operations and constant shadowing of merchant convoys. The ship itself is built around two 5000DWT self insulating fuel tanks. carrying enough fuel and AV gas for a medium sized pirate flotilla. 

Scantly armored and armed, this supply ship needs constant protection from enemy escort and interdiction sorties and it would be wise to be always kept far as far away from the battlefield as possible. A single missile passing the light point defenses is enough to produce a hulking inferno, as well as a shockwave that can put out of action the whole battlegroup.

It goes without saying that no smoking is allowed on the ship, a restriction that Pirates find rather unpleasant..."
sarissa,SHIP," Sporting two heavy 100mm rocket bays and a revolver auto-cannon for defense, the Sarissa-class Heavy Bomber is used by the Lotus Conglomerate Pirates for wolf Pack strike operations, with great success..

The design is based on an old Domain blueprint for assault fighters procured in a raid of the Trendor IV de-civilised world, an old Domain R&D hub for almost a millennium. The Posterior II Anchorage shipyard was quick to reverse-engineer and modify the ancient design, both to fit the modern battlefield and to allow for mass production. The result is a heavy bomber that fits perfectly with the Lotus hit 'n' run tactics.

The two pilots are seated in tandem, with the left responsible for avionics and flying and the one seated on the right manning the 20mm turret and aiming the bombing aperture. The cabin and engines are protected with 12mm dense-alloy panels, a rare sight in Lotus designs due to the high procurement and fitting cost. 

Well armored, heavily armed and with enough speed to enable swift bomb runs, the Sarissa is considered the quintessential bomber for every Pirate wolf pack."
intrepid,SHIP,"The Intrepid-class fast battleship is the epitome of the LotusWorks design bureau. And it shows...

Built to outgun the heaviest corporate convoy escorts conceived, the Intrepid is designed around a lightweight yet durable fast battleship monoframe, based on century old Tri-Tachyon battleship blueprints - duly retrieved via the trademark 'Lotus persuasion ave'. 
The Posterior IIb Anchorage was swift to adapt the design for raiding purposes, reconfiguring the hull for standoff CSS roles by the addition of five (!) large missile mounts sporting lightweight torpedo launchers.

The hull was also extensively optimized for speed, thus giving the class exceptional maneuvering abilities that most ships of its size lack. Unfortunately the need for speed incurred the standard penalty in survivability, a characteristic that the Lotus Pirates are easy to forgo due to the hit 'n' run mentality that love so much. "

gedune_dahaki,SHIP,"An destroyer, with a devastating weapons load-out. Equipped with a short range phase teleporter. Most effective when used in groups.

The Dahaki is one of the very few ships that remain in service since the collapse of the Gedune Empire, and the materials required to build one of these fearsome ships disappeared along with the Gedune home world. When one of these ships are destroyed in combat, it is common procedure to recover as much of the vessel as possible, and given time rebuild the Dahaki from the parts of other fallen Gedune ships.

To most Gedune, the Dahaki is a symbol of the power they once commanded.",,,
,,,,,
gedune_kyirus,SHIP,"A highly advanced scout, capable of blistering speeds but has surprisingly little firepower. The Kyirus is one of the older designs that the Gedune can still manufacture, and as with all old Gedune tech, it would be unwise to underestimate it. Most of the Kyirus is actually engine, or more precisely a nuclear Burndrive. The Kyirus is highly automated, and practically flies itself - or at it would if it didn't need a crew to pilot it.

Almost every weapon on the Kyirus is integrated, meaning that the class is very inflexible. even so, it is one of the best scout ships you could hope to get your hands on.

This ship was originally designed to clean out scrap from a planets orbit. The Kyirus is able to fly though dense debris fields at high velocity thanks to the dual magnetic shunters mounted on the front of the vessel.

A little known fact is that all Gedune ships are Nuclear, a fact that is apparent in ships like the Tenzen, Dahaki and the kyirus. almost every system onboard these ships are powered directly by their nuclear cores, even their weapons.",,,

gedune_nanda,SHIP,"this frigate packs a serious punch, although all those weapons leave no room for a shield generator, and its armour is surprisingly thin. the Nanda is most suited to medium range combat.

When the Gedune still had access to the materials necessary to build their mighty ships, the Nanda was considerably more dangerous, with far better armour, weapons and a shield.

Like the Dahaki, only a few of the original Nandas remain, but those that still have their shields and armour are a threat that starfarers can't afford to ignore.",,,
gedune_tenzen,SHIP,"this ship was deigned with one thing in mind: the pursuit and capture of ships, with weapons that will make short work of anything less than a cruiser and the speed necessary the catch them.

The Tenzen does not cope very well when out numbered, because of the huge flux requirements of its weapons, and yet it exceeds in guerrilla warfare thanks to its ability to activate a nuclear burn in its engines.

In the hands of a skilled captain the Tenzen is a force to be reckoned with.",,,

gedune_flarepd,WEAPON,"An interdictor flare system. These flares try to collide with inbound targets, forcing detonation, and bypassing armour common to heavy ordinance.

The flares are crudely constructed vessels with a basic guidance packages capable of holding active plasma shunted from a ships power core. Once a flare is activated the vessel releases stored plasma, propelling the flare towards incoming targets. 

These flares do not give off an effective decoy to missile guidance systems, and so, rely entirely on a physical collision with the target. Ironically these flares are themselves vulnerable to interference from enemy point defense.

lancer,WEAPON,"The Lancer Quad LRM is a large rack launching system utilizing four high explosive Lancer anti-cruiser assault torpedoes capable of overwhelming any missile defense.

With the Federation's need to overcome modified Jardain anti-missile systems toward the end of the Miner Rebellion, a multi-salvo capable Lancer system was developed.  Utilizing the Lancer torpedo's high speed and heavy armor with the ability to put ordinance on target faster, the Lancer SRM ensured torpedoes would make their mark.  It proved so effective against stations, in short time the Rebels resorted to using suicide tactics with smaller ships in order to stop the crippling barrages.

Due to its large size, the Lancer Quad LRM with Mk 8 launcher platform is often limited to heavy missile barges, though with availability on the black market, there have been instances of it being equipped on smaller ships.",Siege,,
lancer_single,WEAPON,"The Lancer is a high explosive anti-cruiser assault torpedo.  Its high speed and armored plating makes it an ideal weapon for use against well defended targets.

A Federation torpedo developed at the peak of the Miner Rebellion, the Lancer was the answer to insurgent ships equipped with Jardain anti-missile weaponry.  Mass and size limitations forced engineers to sacrifice maneuverability in favor of larger engines and armor.  Despite concerns of whether a dead-fire torpedo would be effective, the Lancer proved itself in several conflicts where jamming methods were used to foul guided missiles off target.  Ultimately, it was a decisive weapon in ending the war, responsible for the destruction of General Tarlane Burtok's command ship and countless others.

With the Federation Lancer torpedo proven highly effective in combat during the Miner Rebellion, a variety of larger capacity launching systems were quickly developed for use on cruisers and battleships. One of these launchers still in use is the Mk 9 dual launch platform.  Not as cumbersome as the Quad LRM variant, the Lancer Dual LRM quickly became a favorite of captains, allowing a more well-rounded weapons loadout. While still a dead-fire torpedo, the Lancer's thick skin and oversized engine makes it difficult to shoot down before hitting its target.  During the war, the Rebels had tales of the torpedo's unstoppable nature, making it a terrifying weapon to combat. With Lancers delivering the final blow on General Tarlane Burtok's command ship, there's no question they were a decisive weapon in the war.

While still considered a modern weapon under development by the Federation, older stockpiles continue to make their way onto the black market. Their legendary reputation makes them a useful intimidation weapon for both mercenaries and pirates, often leading to victory without a fight.",Siege,,
omega,WEAPON,"A Federation superweapon developed in secrecy following the Jardain-Federation first contact war  responsible for horrific destruction in weapon tests.

With the bloody end to the first contact war 95 years ago, the Federation began working on a last resort weapon to decide all future conflicts. Theoretical science quickly became fact when omega particles were first inadvertently created at the Sector 46 Kato Weapons Research Laboratory, destroying the facility and everything within a several light-year radius. Since then, efforts have been focused on improving the delivery methods, as omega particles are extremely unstable, requiring large active containment systems. For this reason, only Federation dreadnaughts are equipped with tactical omega weapons.  Many of these devices consist of a warhead containing only a single omega particle and a massive engine to propel it a safe distance from the launching platform.

While not as heavily armored as enemy destroyers, its large engines allow it to avoid direct confrontations with larger ships.  Armed with anti-fighter support, anti-frigate assault or long range artillery weaponry, the Shogun can be custom tailored for any mission.

Unfortunately, it's gained a reputation of being a jack of all trades, master of none.  Its complex weapon and propulsion systems also make it an expensive ship to maintain, both in and out of battle.",,,
echo,SHIP,"A scout ship used to patrol the remote fringe of Federation space, lacking a shield generator, it's size and agility allow the Echo to avoid most enemy fire.

Designed for sector patrol and deep space missions, the Echo's automated systems allow as few as five crewmembers to pilot it.  While lacking shields, its thick skin and excellent maneuverability give it surprising survivability in combat situations.  With interceptors on its tail, the pilot can often bank hard and simply outturn them.  This ability along with its needler gun has earned it the nickname ""mosquito"".",,,
rickshaw,SHIP,"The Rickshaw is a well armed strike frigate often used in attack or escort roles.  It's low cost and high maneuverability has made it a popular choice for Federation commanders.

Replacing the aging Federation Dakota-class ships, the Rickshaw was designed with more contemporary needs in mind.  The majority of its weapon batteries face forward for use in high speed gun runs or gunship strafing fire.  Criticized for lack of versatility and range of the old Dakota-class frigates, its modern weapon and communication systems better suit the Federation's current needs as old Dakotas are retired.  So successful was the low-cost design, that plans to manufacture it were smuggled onto the black market. Years later, counterfeit Rickshaws began to be spotted in populated space.  Realizing that it could be a valuable trade item, an export variant was put into production.  Enjoyed by mercenaries and pirates alike, Rickshaw-class frigates are common throughout Federation space.",,,
toa,SHIP,"A reliable war vessel armored to the hilt to survive the harshest combat, the Toa can combat swaths of frigates in prolonged engagements.

One of the last great destroyers of the contact war, the Toa could fight on Jardain terms--close and brutal combat.  Designed to withstand extreme punishment, there were instances where barely recognizable battle damaged Toas would continue to fight with engines missing and numerous weapons offline.  So dense was their armor and hull, that their destroyed husks were used in the siege of Corinth as kinetic weapons dropped from orbit.  With the difficulty of scrapping them, when faced with the issue of their replacement, it was decided that maintaining them would be less costly.

Thule Legacy's engineers have taken a pre collapse tanker blueprint and morphed it into a monster. High Command's engineers have spent circles perfecting the Solidstorm's on-board missile launcher optimization systems, making it a very effective heavy assault missile platform. State-of-the-art R.U.N.E alloys, along with missile systems developed from the most advanced designs, mean the Solidstorm may be well on its way to becoming a vital part of Thule Legacy's Navy",,,

Generally eschewing the use of shield systems, they tend to gear their vessels more towards reckless combat.

The Viking MK I is regularly found spearheading Thule Legacy military operations. Viking MK I-class ships move together in groups and can out of hell and forcefully gang up on ships many times their size and overwhelm them. In recent years the Viking MK I has progessivly found its way into the hands of pirates, who love its threatening appearance.",,,
