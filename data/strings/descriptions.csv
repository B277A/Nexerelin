nex_defstation,SHIP,"The Castellum is a light orbital defense platform of modular design, packing a considerable amount of firepower in a modestly sized package. Fairly low cost and ease of assembly make it ubiquitous throughout the Sector.",,,
nex_asgard,SHIP,"The Asgard-class is a fully-fledged battlestation. Capable of taking on entire strike fleets and coming out with only minor damage, it boasts a huge arsenal of weaponry, four flight decks, powerful shield generators and targeting supercomputers that allow it to wipe out destroyers and frigates before they can even get a single shot off. Each individual module is fully customisable, with modular weapon slots and facilities for the repair and re-arming of any kind of fighter the Sector has to offer.

This particular model of battlestation was once used by the Domain to protect high-value targets, from gates to the hyperspace entrances to populated systems. Just one Asgard can dissuade a strike or invasion - otherwise, the attacker risks being blown into little pieces by a neverending hail of ordnance.

The best way to defeat an Asgard-class is to focus fire on its modules, as taking them out lessens its overwhelming firepower and can cause damage to adjacent modules. In particular, the larger modules contain the shield generators and flight decks - but they're also the toughest. EMP weaponry and high-yield, durable torpedoes are recommended.",,,

planet_jangala_independent,CUSTOM,"The cursed emerald of the Corvus system retains a deadly, bountiful biosphere alongside a robust population suited for survival in such terrain. Its vast fields tended by remote harvesters, its seas combed for valuable products, Jangala remains one of the most productive bodies of organics, food, and xenobiological material. Possessing a majority Luddite population, separation from the Hegemony has not shaken the strong militaristic streak in its native citizens.",,"The airtight cities of the poisonous world are remarkably safe, patrolled by a disciplined planetary defense force, composed primarily of former Hegemony personnel. Those who were deemed unfit for service have coalesced into the Knights of the Rose, a paramilitary gang that some citizens rumor are controlled by the former Field Marshal, now Defense Secretary of the planet. Attacks by the Roses are readily denounced by the Defense Secretary, and members of his party are quick to pledge support to aid recovery from such incidents. It is so far considered coincidental that such attacks occur only to those advocating a less than friendly stance with the Hegemony.",
planet_jangala_luddic_church,CUSTOM,"The jewel of the Corvus system is considered holy to most Luddites, its contiguous jungle no less magnificent for its deadly nature. Storms regularly sway the wild forests, fauna is usually violent, and flora populates the biosphere with airborne poison. The great bounty produced by the world’s fields and seas is almost worth the terror produced by what this system’s Luddites have taken to calling the Lost Souls of Jangala; former planetary guard of the Hegemony, now reapers of the jungle.",,"While the robotic harvesters have been kept running, and Jangala Station continues burn maintenance to keep the grasping jungle from the fields and sealed cities, most heavy industry has been disabled. The orbital burning is deemed a necessary evil by the faithful, who conduct prayer for forgiveness whenever operating the station’s powerful weapon. The Knights of Ludd march into the wilderness to complete the crusade of this most holy land, but many do not emerge alive. Perhaps due to remembrance of old alliance, civilian population centers are unharmed, and the Knights slain are respectfully left for collection on the roadside, tattered banner of the Hegemony planted to indicate where the dead lay.",
planet_jangala_luddic_path,CUSTOM,"The holy hand of God's fury has been claimed by Ludd’s Chosen, the Emerald of Corvus now untainted by the heretical finger of Jangala Station’s orbital laser. Farms and seas remain untouched, native xenolife unchecked except in the few holy pilgrimage sites tended to by the Emerald Guardians, serving as both temples for the faithful of Ludd, and embankment points for Ludd’s most holy crusades into the crushing foliage of His most terrible wrath. His will made manifest, the jungle has destroyed all heretical industry of man that dared to defy it in years past. The only remnant of such hubris is the holy crucible of Jangala, through which Pathers must prove themselves worthy of remembrance as saints; the Jangala Hellfighters.",,"As there is no known location of the Hellfighters, Pather crusades will brazenly march the banner of Ludd deep into the jungle, establish defenses, and await the crucible with trembling hand. Those who survive these crusades are shaken, describing figures of burning infernium crashing through the perimeter of their camps. Those who return, dead or alive, share a single trait; the symbol of the Path, burned into their breast with hot iron. The High Crusader has declared the death of the Field Marshal to be of utmost importance, for he defies the will of Ludd. Even in the temples, there are whispers the field marshal cannot be killed, a demon who defies the rules of death. Jangala, the most holy of proving grounds, is a land of devils.",
planet_jangala_persean,CUSTOM,"League officials have declared with the taking of Jangala, the hated Hegemony has been weakened, its forces in full retreat from the planet as they recognize this is the death knell of their empire. This is the official statement. On the surface however, a contradicting message is relayed to planetary defense forces. On this beautiful poisonous planet, there is a threat beyond the violent megastorms, hostile fauna, and toxic flora. Returning League soldiers describe the threat as hollow-eyed terrorists, seemingly wearing no biofilters. Such talk is dissident propaganda, along with the unofficial name ascribed to these agitators, the Toxic Avengers.",,"Each day there is the threat of terrorism, public events and buildings struck by unknown assailants, often crying out a scream of support for the Field Marshal, who is officially dead. The League regularly sends conscripts into the hungry roots of the jungle to confirm his death, and to ensure the supposed Avengers are no longer a threat. While a large number of League assets have been sent into the jungles of Jangala, many remain deeply entrenched in the terrain. Establishing permanent field camps, League commissars direct their conscripts in the blowing of rebel tunnel networks, and the liberal use of incendiary weapons. When night falls however, men turn up missing. They are most usually discovered fighting alongside the rebels, or surrounded by buzzing insects, nailed to the trees. There is no war on Jangala.",
planet_jangala_pirates,CUSTOM,"The coveted jewel of the Persean Sector’s Hegemony has been taken by Bandit King Bloodstone, who first cavorted at the chance to strike with impunity at the green gem of the Corvus system, planning to burn the entire globe to a cinder using the Jangala Station orbital laser. But due minimal understanding of the equipment, the impressive weapon is rarely operational, leading to massive overgrowth of the toxic jungle on the once pristine fields and sealed cities of the jungle world. Worse than the lost food, than the lost fortresses and centers of commerce, would be what remains and thrives in the green hell; the appearance of their biohazardous combat gear has led the pirates to call them the Frogmen.",,"The pirates hold no actual ground on Jangala, only maintaining field outposts around landing zones cleared by hand with burners and machete. With a reward posted for the head of any Frogman by the orbital station’s pirate king, many have touched down with a serrated knife at hand, ready to retire on a paradise world with an account full of credits. Instead, as dawn breaks, the fresh batch of bounty hunters discover the fate of the last wave. Aside from those fallen in combat or to simple traps, those caught alive serve as a warning to never hunt alone; privateers tied to trees, the seed of a native vine having been forced down their throat, growing out in the span of hours. The reward for the Field Marshal’s head is in the millions of credits, yet few dare to hunt such a bounty.",
planet_jangala_sindrian_diktat,CUSTOM,"The Emerald of Corvus proves true the Diktat adage, ""don’t do too poorly, don’t do too well"", for the capable and those to be punished are served the same fate. Posting on Jangala is not feared for its toxic biosphere, its apocalyptic hurricanes, or the hostile xenolife; it is feared for what remains to challenge the Diktat, an open defiance of The Lion of Sindria’s will, the Damned 33rd. Said to have perished and fused with the native flora, they are rumored walking dead retaining fighting acumen they possessed in life. It is even said captives will be taken to the depths of the jungle, fed to the fungi rumored to pilot the soldier’s remains.",,"The Ministry of Environment, responsible for preserving Jangala while exploiting its resources to the greatest possible extent, denies any and all rumors of undead dissidents. Even if such macabre gossip is true, Jangala is well worth the danger for the Diktat to hold. Bioengineers from the Ministry of Science and Technology work around the clock creating fantastical new xenolife from the boundless creatures and plants the jungle world provides. These abominations serve as sources of nutrition, beloved pets, and guardians of the elite. Choice species are designed for combat, tailored for pure audacious spectacle. Xenolife deeper in the jungles are sought after, but rarely captured. Ministry scientists impatient with waiting for appropriate escort in search of valued specimens are found on the outskirts of the jungle, burned to bone and gristle. It is rumored the Damned control the jungle itself, keeping Diktat forces alive purely for the sport of hunting those who dare tread the soil path of the forest. Some have claimed to kill a hostile, but the corpse always seems to disappear, reclaimed by the jungle it is part of.",
planet_jangala_tritachyon,CUSTOM,"Tri-Tachyon employees have taken to calling Jangala “The Green Hell”, not only for its lush but deadly biosphere, but for what remains of the Hegemony defense force of this verdant layer of damnation. Tri-Tachyon Security who’ve escaped describe them as those with no fear of death, and they have earned the name of Death Rangers in hushed tones around the water coolers. It is suspected the majority Luddic population is supplying said dissidents, as the more faithful residents of the planet have been the most troublesome employees. Claims that the company is desecrating a holy site have been considered in regards to who may be a potential sympathizer.",,"The sealed cities of Jangala now conduct research on how to reduce the toxicity of Jangala’s atmosphere, while Jangala Station works overtime burning away the native flora producing the searing venom that layers over the world. Tri-Tachyon employees have taken to using the Jangala Station to strike where the Death Rangers are suspected to hide, an innovative measure that unfortunately has produced no proven results, as the absolute nature of the orbital laser obliterates any trace of a supposed target. Attempts to engage on the ground level have almost completely stopped, as those not killed in combat are discovered in the early morning, just outside the population centers, biofilter masks removed after being strung up on poles.",

planet_asharu_hegemony,CUSTOM,"A desert planet, product of an abortive terraforming project from before the Collapse. Populated by a few hardy settlers, determined soldiers, and oddballs. The Hegemony maintains a small but robust administration, where patrols chase down pirates and protect what little communities and commercial activities remain. They have earned the name of the Rough Riders.

Alas the chaos of the Collapse halted the ice and suspected Luddic sabotage destroyed the shade.

planet_asharu_luddic_path,CUSTOM,"A desert planet, product of an abortive terraforming project from before the Collapse. Populated by a few fiercely dedicated priests, crusaders, and penitents.

Alas the chaos of the Collapse halted the ice and suspected Luddic sabotage destroyed the shade.

Trials face the faithful in their journey; feats of wit, combat, even exposure to the elements until one is graced with a vision from Ludd Himself.",
planet_asharu_persean,CUSTOM,"A desert planet, product of an abortive terraforming project from before the Collapse. It is populated by those who remained after Asharu's takeover by the League, and a minor house of Filkenhild, who successfully acquired the planet through an auction. The barren nature of the planet came as a surprise to the newly-bankrupted house, bleeding their subjects for all they had.
