	"description":"Technically not a faction in itself, many soldiers of fortune, mercenaries and free captains share the same basic beliefs and ideas. Many are runaways from the mainstream Sector society - usually oppressed by the status quo, stowaways from core worlds. Most pirate captains would hardly call themselves such, rather seeing themselves as challengers to the inept rule of the Hegemony or the League, seeking vengeance for the wrongs caused by such a misled society. These captains are all characterized by their insatiable thrist for freedom, autonomy and self-protection. Naturally, they give little thought to those that carry an official Hegemony or League identification beacon, reserving their magnanimity for those they would call their equals - other pirates.",
