	"description":"The Isoran Confederacy formed out of a coalition of loosely allied planets, eventually becoming a relatively powerful state in its own locale. The Isoran confederacy relies primarily on blueprints that were originally controlled by the member colonies, most of them being midline ships. They are also one of the few legitimate states not preyed upon by the Green Sun pirates after having come to a so-called permanent trade arrangment, which is really nothing more than monthly tribute payments, and purchasing over-priced ships that Green Sun monopolizes.",
